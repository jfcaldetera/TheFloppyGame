The Floppy Game
================

In this game, try to dodge/shield against the bullets while killing enemies.
Shielding from bullets and firing lasers increases your ships heat.
If your ship overheats it will no longer be able to move.
If your ship runs out of energy it will not be able to shield or fire.
The game currently only has two levels in it.

Building the game

This is just a simple game I created in my free time.
To build it, simply use ant on the file "ant.xml" with the "dist" flag.
The game should be located in the "dist" directory after building.
